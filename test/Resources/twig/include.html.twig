        We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent.
        I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he
        should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says,
        <em>'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.'</em> I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.
